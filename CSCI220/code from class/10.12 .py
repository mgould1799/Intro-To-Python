##cant split list. why?
##values = [.....]
# xVal= values.split() (str method)

##list(range(3,7) -> [3,4,5,6]
##list("Brandi") -> ["B","R","A","N","D","I"]
##meta data - data talks about data

##look over binary notes

##ascii value- a code that is stored within universal systems
## ord("a") - 97
## ord(" ")- 32
##


##chr- gives askee character that goes with it
##chr(97) - "a"
##chr(65)- "A"

## for i in range(ord("A"),ord("Z") +1):
    ##print(i)

## for i in range(ord("A",ord("Z"+1):
##      print(str(i)+ ": " +chr(i))

##this is used for encryption. message is numeric so you are able to change values
## this would make it scrambled 


##%26 would make numbers stay between 0-25 **% used alot during encryption

##format method used for str **cant mutate a str

##"This is {1} {0}.".format("example","an") -> 'This is an example'
## this places arguments into a statement
##"This is {1} {0}. And not {1} exciting {0}!".format("example,"an")
##--> 'This is an example. And not an exciting example!'

##round(9.99999,2)-->10
##formating is important


##Payment= 9.938743947
##print("Payment: ${0}".format(pay)
##Payment: $9.834838383483
##print("Payment: ${0:10.2f}.format(pay) .2 is how many decimals and f is fixed
##Payment: $        9.83
##Payment = 15.999999
##print("Payment: ${0:010.2f}"
#Payment: $00016.00 **this gives 10 digits to be shown and parts are filled by zeros 
##^ centers >moves it to left < moves to right

##look at 10.1 notes
