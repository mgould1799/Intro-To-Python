    Modify the following function to:

    Draw squares (20 X 20) instead of circles. Make sure that the center of the square
    is at the point where the user clicks. Make the window 400 by 400.

    Have each successive click draw an additional square on the screen (rather
    than just moving the existing one).

    Display a message on the window "Click again to quit" after the loop, and
    wait for a final click before closing the window.
